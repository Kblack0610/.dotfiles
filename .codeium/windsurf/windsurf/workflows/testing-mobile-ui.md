- Check if expo is running. If not start it with npm start in history mobile.

- If there's error make sure npm is set up correctly

- Make sure the web server is running

- start localhost:19006 in chromium.

-After this has all been verified, go through .windsurf/ui-worflows for ui flows needed to test the current
feature.

- After testing, if there's errors or wrong functionality then fix and re-loop through the workflow.

- If everything is working, close chromium and any other processes you started.
