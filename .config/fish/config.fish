# Fish Shell Configuration
# This file is based on the user's .zshrc settings.

# --- Zsh-like Configuration ---
# Fish doesn't have themes like Zsh, but we can use Starship for the prompt.
# eval "$(starship init fish)" is handled by Starship's own setup.

# --- History Settings ---
# Fish manages history automatically, but we can set limits.
set -g fish_history_max_size 5000

# Fish also handles duplicate history entries and history sharing automatically,
# so no specific commands are needed for those Zsh options.

# --- Plugins and Sourcing ---
# Fish has its own plugin manager. The most common is Fisher.
# You would need to install Fisher first: curl -sL https://git.io/fisher | source
# Then install plugins like this: fisher install <plugin-name>
# These plugins are similar to the ones you had in Zsh:
# fisher install jethrokuan/z (for zsh-autosuggestions equivalent)
# fisher install edc/bass (for sourcing bash scripts, if needed)

# Sourcing zsh-syntax-highlighting and fzf
# Fish has built-in autosuggestions and syntax highlighting, so you don't need these.
# fzf for Fish is usually installed separately and adds its own functions.
# [ -f ~/.fzf.fish ] && source ~/.fzf.fish

# Autojump
# The autojump package for Fish typically installs its own configuration.
# The following line would be needed if it doesn't:
# source /usr/share/autojump/autojump.fish

# --- Key Bindings and Editor Mode ---
# Fish handles vi-mode with a single command.
fish_vi_key_bindings

# Ctrl-P, Ctrl-N, and Ctrl-R mappings
# Fish has built-in history search, but we can rebind them.
bind \cn history-search-forward
bind \cp history-search-backward
bind \cr history-search-backward

# --- Environment Variables ---
# Use `set -x` to export environment variables.
set -x ZSH_DISABLE_COMPFIX "true"
set -x HISTSIZE 5000
set -x HISTFILE ~/.zsh_history
set -x SAVEHIST 5000

# --- Aliases ---
# Use the `abbr` command for simple aliases (abbreviations).

abbr ct "kitty @ set-tab-title"
abbr lg "lazygit"
abbr sysz "$HOME/.bin/sysz"
abbr python "/usr/bin/python3"

# --- Functions ---
# For more complex scripts, create a function.
function x11-clip-wrap-widgets
    # Fish doesn't have widgets like Zsh. This function's logic would need to be
    # re-implemented using Fish's event handlers or hooks, which is more complex.
    # It is not a direct one-to-one translation.

# Check for cowsay and fortune at startup
