# Windows VDI Setup

Bootstraps a Deloitte Canada Azure Win11 VDI (or any reasonably modern Win11 box) into a usable Linux-first dev environment. Uses **winget** — built into Windows 11, no third-party bootstrapping, no Cloudflare-fronted proxy issues.

## What this gives you

The default invocation is **configs-only** — it pulls the dotfiles repo and copies configs to their Windows locations. No winget package installs, no WSL provisioning unless you pass `-Install`.

- **Configs deployed always** (default behavior): GlazeWM, Zebar (`kblack-minimal` pack), Windows Terminal settings, PowerShell profile, `.wslconfig`, nvim, opencode, starship, lazygit.
- **Windows-side packages** (`-Install`): Windows Terminal, GlazeWM, Zebar, Flow Launcher, PowerToys, JetBrainsMono Nerd Font. The dev toolchain (nvim, tmux, ripgrep, fzf, lazygit, gh, node, …) lives inside WSL Arch — install it there once, not duplicated on the Windows side.
- **WSL2 Arch** (`-Install`): primary dev environment, runs `linux/install_arch.sh` from inside the WSL distro. Full parity with the Linux dotfiles.
- **Cross-platform CLI on Windows too** (`-Install -Full`): adds `BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC`, `sharkdp.fd`, `junegunn.fzf`, `JesseDuffield.lazygit`, `Starship.Starship`, `OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS`, `marlocarlo.psmux`, `GitHub.cli`, `Docker.DockerCLI`, `PostgreSQL.PostgreSQL.17`. Skip unless you want them invokable directly from PowerShell.
- **Windows Terminal** with three profiles: Arch (WSL), PowerShell, Git Bash.
- **GlazeWM** — i3-style tiling, animations off (RDP-friendly). Apps auto-route to labeled workspaces (terminals → 1, browsers → 2, editors → 3, chat → 4).
- **Flow Launcher** — dmenu equivalent. `Alt+D` opens a fuzzy launcher (hotkey pinned via `.config/windows/flow-launcher/Settings.json`). Replaces PowerToys Run, which we tried and found slow with a thin plugin ecosystem. PowerToys itself is still installed for FancyZones / Keyboard Manager / etc., just not as the launcher.
- **PowerShell profile** — starship + history search + `wsld`/`dot`/`lg` shortcuts.
- **`.wslconfig`** — caps WSL at 4 GB RAM so the 8 GB VDI doesn't thrash.

## Preflight: enable WSL2 on the VDI image

WSL2 is **not enabled by default** on the locked-down Deloitte VDI image. `wsl --install` will fail without it. Before running with `-Install` (or with `-Install -SkipWsl` followed eventually by a non-`-SkipWsl` run):

1. Open a ServiceNow ticket (or message Anton, who handles these for the engineering teams) asking for **WSL2 to be enabled on your Azure VDI**.
2. After they confirm, in PowerShell on the VDI run:
   ```pwsh
   wsl --status
   ```
   You should see *"Default Version: 2"* and a kernel version. If you see *"WSL is not installed"* or `0x80370102`, it's not enabled yet — go back to step 1.

If you don't want to wait, see [Day-1 mode](#day-1-mode--skipwsl-with--install) below — you can install Windows-side packages right now and add WSL Arch later.

## How to install

### Path A — direct (preferred)

In a fresh PowerShell on the VDI:

```pwsh
# Default: pull dotfiles + push configs (no winget, no WSL).
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kblack0610/.dotfiles/main/.local/src/installation_scripts/windows/bootstrap.ps1 | iex

# After the repo is on disk, add packages + WSL Arch when you're ready:
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.dotfiles\.local\src\installation_scripts\windows\bootstrap.ps1" -Install
```

### Path B — OneDrive fallback

Clipboard between your Mac and the VDI is **disabled** by Deloitte policy. OneDrive is the bridge:

1. On your Mac, sync this repo's `bootstrap.ps1` into OneDrive.
2. In the VDI's PowerShell:
   ```pwsh
   pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:OneDrive\bootstrap.ps1"
   ```

If even GitHub is blocked inside the VDI, zip the whole repo into OneDrive, expand to `%USERPROFILE%\.dotfiles`, then run the entry point directly.

### Day-1 mode (-SkipWsl with -Install)

If Anton hasn't enabled WSL2 yet but you still want the Windows-side packages installed:

```pwsh
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.dotfiles\.local\src\installation_scripts\windows\bootstrap.ps1" -Install -SkipWsl
```

When WSL2 is enabled, re-run with `-Install` (drop `-SkipWsl`) to provision Arch.

## How the bootstrap is structured

`bootstrap.ps1` is just a thin orchestrator. The work lives in three idempotent modules, each runnable on its own:

| Step | Script | What it does | When it runs |
|------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | `sync_dotfiles.ps1` | `winget install Git.Git` if missing, then clone or `git pull --ff-only` the repo into `%USERPROFILE%\.dotfiles`. | always |
| 2 | `install_packages.ps1` | `winget install` each ID below, then `wsl --install -d archlinux --no-launch` (skipped with `-SkipWsl`). | only with `-Install` |
| 3 | **WSL present**: `.local/bin/apply-windows-configs` (bash, via `wsl -- bash -lc ...`). **WSL absent**: `apply_configs.ps1` (PS1 fallback). Both deploy the same configs. | always |
| 3b | `apply_configs.ps1 -WslBootstrapOnly` | Only when `-Install` AND WSL is present: clones the dotfiles inside Arch and runs `stow`. Skips the hard-blocked config-copy section. | only with `-Install` and WSL present |

### Config-application policy (HARD-BLOCKED on WSL machines)

`apply_configs.ps1`'s **config-copy** section refuses to run if any WSL distro is installed -- it `throw`s with a pointer to the bin script. No `-Force`, no escape hatch. Rationale: copying WSL -> `/mnt/c` via the WSL kernel is materially faster than robocopy through `\\wsl$`, and the bash script is the one we actually iterate on. The PS1 path exists only for day-1 / no-WSL machines.

Canonical workflow once WSL is up:
```bash
# From inside WSL Arch
apply-windows-configs              # auto-detects Windows username
apply-windows-configs --dry-run    # preview without writing
apply-windows-configs --win-user keblack  # explicit override
```

`bootstrap.ps1` does this routing for you: when it sees a WSL distro, step 3 dispatches to the bin script via `wsl -- bash -lc 'apply-windows-configs ...'`. The WSL-Arch first-run (clone + stow inside Arch, only on `-Install`) is *not* a config script and still runs from PS1 via `apply_configs.ps1 -WslBootstrapOnly`.

### Packages (step 2)

Two tiers — minimal is the default when `-Install` is passed.

**Minimal (`-Install`):** `Microsoft.WindowsTerminal`, `glzr-io.glazewm`, `glzr-io.zebar`, `Flow-Launcher.Flow-Launcher`, `Microsoft.PowerToys`, `DEVCOM.JetBrainsMonoNerdFont`. (Git is handled by `sync_dotfiles.ps1` separately.)

**Full (`-Install -Full`):** the minimal set plus `GitHub.cli`, `Docker.DockerCLI`, `Starship.Starship`, `OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS`, `marlocarlo.psmux`, `BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC`, `sharkdp.fd`, `junegunn.fzf`, `JesseDuffield.lazygit`, `PostgreSQL.PostgreSQL.17`.

The split exists because the cross-platform CLI tools (rg, fd, fzf, lazygit, gh, node, etc.) all live inside WSL Arch as part of the Linux-side install. There's no point pulling Windows-side duplicates onto a 8 GB VDI unless you want them callable directly from PowerShell.

> PostgreSQL's installer wants admin to register a Windows service. On the locked-down VDI that step fails — `psql.exe` still lands on `PATH` for remote-DB connections, which is the usual VDI use case.

### Config copies (step 3)

| Source in repo | Destination on Windows |
|---|---|
| `.config/windows/terminal/settings.json` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbce\LocalState\settings.json` |
| `.config/windows/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` | `$PROFILE` |
| `.config/windows/glazewm/config.yaml` | `%USERPROFILE%\.glzr\glazewm\config.yaml` |
| `.config/windows/zebar/settings.json` | `%USERPROFILE%\.glzr\zebar\settings.json` |
| `.config/windows/zebar/kblack-minimal/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.glzr\zebar\kblack-minimal\` |
| `.config/windows/wsl/.wslconfig` | `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig` |
| `.config/nvim/` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim\` |
| `.config/opencode/` | `%APPDATA%\opencode\` (excluding `node_modules/`) |
| `.config/starship.toml` | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\starship.toml` |
| `.config/jesseduffield/lazygit/config.yml` | `%APPDATA%\lazygit\config.yml` |
| `.config/firefox/policies.json` | `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\distribution\policies.json` (admin; on VDI deep-merged with `policies.vdi.json` first — see [Firefox on this VDI](#firefox-on-this-vdi) below) |
| `.config/firefox/user.js`, `chrome/userChrome.css`, `containers.json` | `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*.default-release\` (per profile, no admin) |

GlazeWM auto-launches Zebar via its `startup_commands` (`shell-exec zebar startup`), so the bar appears on every monitor (`monitorSelection.type=all` in the `kblack-minimal` pack's `bar` widget).

## Why copy configs instead of symlinking?

Windows symlinks need Developer Mode or admin. Corporate VDIs typically allow neither. Re-running the installer re-copies, so editing the repo and re-running keeps everything fresh.

## Verification

After the installer finishes, **close and reopen PowerShell** so the new `$PROFILE` and `$PATH` take effect.

### Default (configs only)

```pwsh
git --version                                                   # already on the VDI image
Test-Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.glzr\glazewm\config.yaml"          # True
Test-Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.glzr\zebar\kblack-minimal\zpack.json"  # True
```

### After `-Install` (minimal packages)

```pwsh
Get-Command wt, glazewm, zebar    # all resolve via winget installs
```

`rg`, `fd`, `fzf`, `lazygit`, `starship`, `gh`, `node` are intentionally NOT on Windows-side `$PATH` — they live inside WSL Arch. If you want them in PowerShell too, re-run with `-Install -Full`.

### After WSL provisioning (`-Install`, no `-SkipWsl`)

```sh
# Inside WSL Arch (after `wsl --shutdown` then re-launch)
nvim --version
free -h                     # should show ~4 GB total
readlink ~/.config/nvim     # → /home/<you>/.dotfiles/.config/nvim
```

```pwsh
# PowerShell on Windows
wsl --list --verbose        # archlinux, state Running, version 2
```

### After `-Install -Full`

The starship prompt should render automatically. All of `nvim`, `rg`, `fzf`, `lazygit`, `starship`, `gh`, `node` resolve directly in PowerShell.

GlazeWM: `Alt+Enter` spawns Windows Terminal; `Alt+1..9` switches workspaces; `Alt+Shift+R` reloads config; `Alt+D` opens Flow Launcher (dmenu equivalent).

Windows taskbar position is a Windows setting (*Settings → Personalization → Taskbar → Taskbar behaviors → Taskbar alignment*) — GlazeWM does not manage or hide it. If the taskbar isn't on the bottom, change it there.

## Docker without Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop needs admin and IT approval on the VDI — neither required here. With `-Install`, the bootstrap installs `docker` (daemon + CLI) inside WSL Arch; with `-Install -Full` it additionally installs `Docker.DockerCLI` on Windows so `docker` works directly from PowerShell. Without `-Full`, just call into WSL (`wsl docker ps`). After a fresh install:

```pwsh
# 1. Reload WSL so the [boot] systemd=true that install_arch.sh wrote takes effect
wsl --shutdown
# 2. Start an Arch shell — systemd will be PID 1 and dockerd auto-starts
wsl -d archlinux
```

Inside Arch: `docker ps` should work. If you ran with `-Install -Full`, point the Windows CLI at WSL's daemon:

```pwsh
docker context create wsl --docker host=npipe:////./pipe/docker_wsl
docker context use wsl
```

Otherwise just run `wsl docker ps` / alias it.

## Optional: debloat

`debloat.ps1` is an opt-in, HKCU-only noise reducer (widgets, Start recommendations,
Spotlight ads, Quick Access frequent/recent, OneDrive ads in Explorer, RDP
animations). It's intentionally minimal: no admin, no AppX removal, no service
edits, no telemetry policies — nothing that fights the corporate image.

```pwsh
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.dotfiles\.local\src\installation_scripts\windows\debloat.ps1"
```

It restarts Explorer at the end to apply taskbar changes; pass `-NoRestartExplorer`
to skip that. Some Spotlight surfaces only fully clear after sign-out.

## Firefox on this VDI

`apply_configs.ps1` deploys Firefox in two layers:

1. **Enterprise policy** — `.config/firefox/policies.json` → `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\distribution\policies.json`. Locks the GPU offload prefs (`gfx.webrender.all`, `gfx.webrender.compositor`, `media.hardware-video-decoding.force-enabled`, `media.wmf.dxva.enabled`, `media.wmf.hevc.enabled`, plus Linux-only `media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled` and `widget.dmabuf.force-enabled` which Firefox simply ignores on Windows). Needs admin to write to Program Files — script warns and continues if not elevated; the per-profile layer below is the fallback.
2. **Per-profile** — `user.js`, `chrome/userChrome.css`, `containers.json` into every `*.default-release` profile under `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\`. No admin needed. This is also the resilient layer if a corp-managed `policies.json` ever wins under Program Files.

Verify after install: `about:support` → `Enterprise Policies: Active`, `Legacy User Stylesheets: Active true`, and `Important Locked Preferences` lists the seven GPU prefs.

### GPU offload here is unrecoverable — don't re-debug it

This VDI is a **Hyper-V Gen2 guest** (`Win32_ComputerSystem.Model = "Virtual Machine"`, BIOS = Hyper-V UEFI) with **no GPU-PV / DDA passthrough**. The only display adapters are `Microsoft Hyper-V Video` (synthetic, display-only, paired with `Basic Render Driver` = WARP for rendering) and `Microsoft Remote Display Adapter` (RDP Indirect Display Driver, active because we're connected over RDP). Firefox cannot offload anything to a GPU because there isn't one:

- The locked GPU prefs above all apply, but `about:support` still reports `Compositing: WebRender (Software)` and `Hardware Decoding: Unsupported` for every codec.
- Decision log shows `D3D11_COMPOSITING: env blocklisted FEATURE_FAILURE_EMPTY_DRIVER_VERSION`, `WEBRENDER_COMPOSITOR: runtime unavailable FEATURE_FAILURE_DCOMP_NOT_ANGLE`, `HARDWARE_VIDEO_DECODING: runtime unavailable FEATURE_FAILURE_BROKEN_TEXTURE_SHARING`.
- Workarounds that **don't help**: `MOZ_GFX_SPOOF_*` env vars or `layers.acceleration.force-enabled` clear the blocklist text but reveal WARP underneath — "hardware" compositing in name only, often slower than the software path. `media.hardware-video-decoding.force-enabled` does not bypass `BROKEN_TEXTURE_SHARING` (it's a runtime probe, not a static blocklist).
- Workarounds that **also don't help**: running Firefox under WSL2 via `/dev/dxg` routes to the same host WARP adapter — strictly worse than Windows-side because of WSLg's broken DRI3/dma-buf for video.
- The only real fix is **infrastructure**: ask IT to enable GPU-Partitioning on this session host pool, or (if this is AVD) move to an NVads-A10 / NVv4 SKU.

Keep `policies.json` deployed — those prefs are correct, no-op penalty here, real win on any non-VDI Windows box you sync this config to.

### CPU-savings overlay (`policies.vdi.json`)

Because GPU offload is impossible here, the achievable win is **cutting CPU work**. `.config/firefox/policies.vdi.json` carries a `Preferences` overlay that's deep-merged into the base `policies.json` **only when VDI is detected** (Hyper-V VM with no real GPU adapter visible). On a real-GPU machine these prefs are net losses (capped frame rate, software compositor preferred over real GPU, AV1 disabled), so the overlay is intentionally NOT applied unconditionally.

| Pref | Value | What it buys (on VDI) |
|---|---|---|
| `layout.frame_rate` | `30` | Caps repaint at 30 fps — typically 30–40% CPU drop on busy pages |
| `image.animation_mode` | `"once"` | Kills looping GIFs |
| `media.av1.enabled` | `false` | Forces VP9/H.264 — much cheaper to software-decode on Zen 3 with no HW assist |
| `dom.ipc.processCount` | `4` | Fewer content procs — better fit for a CPU-bound 8 GB VM |
| `gfx.webrender.software.opengl` | `true` | Prefers the SIMD-optimized software compositor over WARP |

Detection logic in `apply_configs.ps1`:

```
$vcs            = Get-CimInstance Win32_VideoController
$hasHyperVVideo = ($vcs | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq 'Microsoft Hyper-V Video' }).Count -gt 0
$nonSynthetic   = $vcs | Where-Object {
    $_.Name -notmatch '^Microsoft (Hyper-V Video|Remote Display Adapter|Basic (Display|Render) (Adapter|Driver))$'
}
$isVdi          = $hasHyperVVideo -and ($nonSynthetic.Count -eq 0)
```

We anchor on `Microsoft Hyper-V Video` specifically because it is the VMBus synthetic device that ONLY appears inside Hyper-V guests — never on bare-metal Windows (the Hyper-V parent partition uses the real GPU driver), never on VMware/VirtualBox/Parallels (they expose their own vendor adapters), never on Snapdragon/Apple-Silicon Windows. Then we require zero non-synthetic adapters, which keeps a Hyper-V guest WITH GPU-PV passthrough out of the VDI bucket (the partitioned adapter reports the host vendor name alongside Hyper-V Video). Conservative on purpose: false negatives just mean the overlay isn't applied; false positives would slow down a real workstation.

### Which entry point writes what?

`policies.json` deployment is **only** done by `apply_configs.ps1` (the elevated PowerShell entry point), because Program Files writes require admin. The WSL convenience wrapper `.local/bin/apply-windows-configs` skips `policies.json` entirely — it only mirrors the per-profile files (`user.js`, `containers.json`, `chrome/userChrome.css`) into `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*.default-release\`. So:

- **Running `apply-windows-configs` from WSL** (any machine): cannot pollute a non-VDI Firefox with VDI prefs, because it doesn't write `policies.json` at all and `user.js` carries no VDI-specific prefs.
- **Running `apply_configs.ps1` elevated** (any machine): writes `policies.json`; the VDI overlay is merged in only when the detection above returns true.

## Caveats

- **8 GB VDI RAM**: keep WSL's cap at 4 GB. Run Teams on your physical Mac (per Deloitte's VDI best-practices slide) — don't double up inside the VDI.
- **GlazeWM over RDP**: animations are off. If tiling still stutters, fall back to FancyZones (PowerToys).
- **Zebar bar**: the `kblack-minimal` pack at `.config/windows/zebar/kblack-minimal/` ships a single `bar` widget (workspace pills + open-window list + HH:mm clock — no CPU/memory/network/weather). Top of every monitor (`monitorSelection.type=all`). The Windows taskbar at the bottom stays put for the system tray (Teams, OneDrive). Zebar starts and stops with GlazeWM via `startup_commands` / `shutdown_commands`; if you launch `zebar.exe` manually instead, it'll only attach to the monitor it was launched on. To restyle the bar, edit `.config/windows/zebar/kblack-minimal/index.html` and re-run `apply_configs.ps1` — the upstream `starter` pack at `~/.glzr/zebar/starter/` is left untouched (so Zebar updates can't clobber your customizations).
- **Compliance (Policy 406)**: client data stays on the VDI. Don't `wsl --export` `/home` tarballs containing client work.
- **Weekly reboots**: the VDI re-images on a schedule. WSL persists across reboots, but if your VDI is ever wiped, re-run the bootstrap one-liner.
- **UAC prompts**: winget's default install scope is machine-wide, which can prompt for elevation. The Deloitte VDI image typically allows this; if it doesn't, append `--scope user` inside `Install-Pkg` in `install_packages.ps1`.

## Re-syncing after dotfiles changes

```pwsh
# Default = pull repo + deploy configs (no winget, no WSL). Fast.
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.dotfiles\.local\src\installation_scripts\windows\bootstrap.ps1"
```

After it finishes, reload GlazeWM (`Alt+Shift+R`) and restart any open Windows Terminal / nvim sessions to pick up new configs.

Add `-Install` if you also want to re-verify winget packages — that's slower because it lists each package, but it's the right call after editing `$MinimalPackages` / `$FullExtraPackages` in `install_packages.ps1`.

You can also call any single module directly when you only want one piece — e.g. `& sync_dotfiles.ps1` to just `git pull`.

```sh
# Or just the Linux side, inside WSL
cd ~/.dotfiles && git pull && stow --restow .
```
