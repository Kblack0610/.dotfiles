# notes

A single, profile-aware binary that owns all **journal + zettelkasten** logic for
the `~/.notes` vault. The git/MQTT **sync layer is separate** (shell + systemd/
launchd) and untouched — this tool only reads and writes note files.

Everything is pure Rust (chrono for dates), so behaviour is identical on macOS and
Linux: no GNU-vs-BSD `date`/`sed`/`stat` divergence, no Python-on-Mac drift.

## Why it exists

The old journal logic was split across `journal-create` (bash), two Python scripts,
and shell aliases — each with its **own hardcoded path**, so per-machine roots were
impossible and failures (a missing note, a mistyped heading) were silent. This binary
unifies all of it behind one config and adds a `doctor` command so problems are
visible instead of mysterious.

## Install

```sh
cargo build --release
ln -sf ../../.dotfiles/.local/src/notes-cli/target/release/notes ~/.local/bin/notes
```

`notes-bootstrap` does both automatically (and on every machine).

## Configuration

`~/.config/notes/config.toml` (symlinked from `~/.dotfiles/.config/notes/`). The
binary also falls back to `$NOTES_CONFIG` and `~/.dotfiles/.config/notes/config.toml`,
and to a built-in `personal` default if none exist.

Active profile resolves: `--profile` → `$NOTES_PROFILE` → `[hostname_map]` (by
`hostname -s`) → `default_profile`. This is what lets a corporate machine root its
daily notes inside `employment/jobs/<job>/` while a personal machine uses
`journal/daily` — same git repo, different active location.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `notes today` | Idempotent daily note. Carries **Priority** forward (day-stamped); rolls unfinished **Focus** into the carryover backlog; links refs; footer links to backlogs. |
| `notes path` | Print today's note path (for `nvim "$(notes path)"`). |
| `notes link-refs` | Link today's `refs/<date>/*.md` into the note's `## Refs`. |
| `notes summarize [--date D] [--force]` | Append a day's summary to the continuous monthly log. **Dedup-safe**; WARNs on gaps/empty extraction. |
| `notes archive [--month M] [--dry-run] [--backfill]` | Roll a month into the monthly summary + move dailies to the archive tree. |
| `notes backlog <fun\|carryover>` | Tidy a backlog (sweep checked → `## Done`, restamp day counts) and print its path. |
| `notes seed-backlogs [--from N] [--force]` | One-time migration: lift `## Fun` + `## Carry Over` out of a daily note into the backlog files. |
| `notes zettel new "<title>"` | Create `permanent/<id>-<slug>.md` (id = `YYYYMMDDThhmm`). |
| `notes index [--rebuild]` | Scan `[[wikilinks]]`; report or rebuild `index/` backlinks + MOC. |
| `notes doctor` | Diagnose: config/profile, dirs, **summarize gaps**, heading validity, sync freshness, service status, dead links/orphans. |
| `notes config` | Print the resolved profile + all paths. |

`--verbose` echoes the structured log (also written to `~/.local/state/notes/journal.log`).

## Daily-note model

Lean by design — only fresh **Focus** + **Priority** live inline. **Fun** and
**Carry Over** are standing backlog files (`journal/backlogs/`) linked at the bottom.
Completed backlog items move to a `## Done` section in the same file (history via git +
`daily_archive/`), so there's no separate done log.

## Wiring

- Aliases (`.commonrc`): `today`, `fun`, `co`, `zk`, `ndoctor` → the binary.
- Timers: `journal-daily-summarize.service` → `notes summarize`,
  `journal-monthly-archive.service` → `notes archive`.
- Legacy `journal-create` + the two Python scripts are deprecated fallbacks.

## Tests

`cargo test` — covers the historically fragile bits: date/day-count stamping,
carry-forward filtering, section extraction, profile + hostname resolution,
backlog sweep, link extraction.
