# Improved FZF Developer Script

## Task Description
Create a more responsive version of `fzf_dev.sh` that:
1. Saves command history
2. Shows options more closely related to the current directory the user is in

## Plan
[X] Create project structure
[X] Create the improved fzf script (fzf_dev.sh)
  - [X] Add history saving functionality
  - [X] Add directory-aware suggestions
  - [X] Make it more responsive
[X] Create documentation (README.md)
[ ] Make the script executable
[ ] Test the script

## Lessons
- When working with file system operations, ensure you have the correct permissions and paths
- Caching directory-specific suggestions improves responsiveness
- Using md5sum of the current directory path creates unique cache identifiers
- Prioritizing history entries above directory suggestions creates a better user experience

## Implementation Notes
- Used fzf (fuzzy finder) for interactive filtering
- Added history saving in `$HOME/.fzf_dev_history`
- Added cache for directory suggestions to improve responsiveness
- Implemented project-type detection (Node.js, Python, Go, Docker, etc.)
- Added preview window for better context
- Made sure to handle special commands like "cd" properly
